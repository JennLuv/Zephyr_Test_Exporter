The Jira Zephyr Cycles Exporter is a Python utility that retrieves test cycle data from Zephyr for Jira and exports it into a structured CSV file.

It connects to the Jira Zephyr API, fetches cycle summaries, including execution counts and statuses, and formats them into a clean, tabular CSV. This makes it easy to analyze testing progress in tools like Excel or Google Sheets.
